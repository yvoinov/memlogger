==========
FIX: Logger format %d to %lu.
FIX: warning: "std::fstream {anonymous}::FileForReadWrite::fd [-Wreorder]"
FIX: Class MemoryFunctions must me instantiated on each hooked function to prevent segfault on dlsym() call.

11-30-2020
==========
IMPROVEMENT: Added static buffer for output to avoid malloc.
FIX: Removed calloc overriding due to dlsym() implementations with 32 bytes calloc, which can lead to endless recursion;
     due to calloc implementations uses malloc in most cases, this do not skew overall statistics.
     However, this leads better compatibility with different libC/glibC.
